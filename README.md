A transport plugin for integrating Errsole with the winston@3.x logger.

## What is Errsole?

Errsole is a Node.js logger with a built-in web dashboard. In this dashboard, you can easily view, filter, and search your app logs.

If you are already using Winston for logging in your Node.js project and want to integrate Errsole, you can use the `winston-errsole` transport. This plugin streams your Winston logs directly to Errsole, providing you with a complete logging solution without altering your current setup.
